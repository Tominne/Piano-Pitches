<h3><strong>The Whai Piano</strong></h3>
<h1>The Choir of the Dev Academy Gods</h1>
This project has been the product of the love, grit and tears of the Piano Pitches members. These members are: Dillon, Renee, Min, Martin and Dallin. This is truly music to everyone's ears. Beauty is always in the ear of the beholder.

Included in the Whai Piano are the voices of the Whai 2023 cohort. We know this is a fun way to remember our time together and also laugh at each other.

## Using Whai Piano

Each key in the whai piano contains the voice from a cohort member. Press the key and their voice will play. Information about the individual will also pop up below the piano.

## The Playground

The purpose of the playground is to be a place for non-cohort individuals to add their voices. Thus modelling the idea of inclusion. The instructions for adding yourself as a choir participant are found in the 'Adding a Participant' section.

## Adding a Participant

To add yourself as a participant in the online form you must have two things ready. (1) An image file that will be your avatar and (2) an audio file (.mp3) that contains your voice singing the word 'whai'. In the form you will be asked a random question. An input field is provided so that you can answer this question. All of this information will be stored on a secure database. When a user presses your key on the piano your avatar, question, answer, name and audio will appear.
